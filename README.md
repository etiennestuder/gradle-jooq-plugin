# Overview
[Gradle](http://www.gradle.org) plugin that integrates [jOOQ](http://www.jooq.org). For each jOOQ configuration declared
in the build, the plugin adds a task to generate the jOOQ Java sources from a given database schema and includes the
generated sources in the specified source set. Multiple configurations are supported. The code generation tasks fully
participate in the Gradle uptodate checks. The plugin can be applied on both Java projects and Android projects.

You can find out more details about the actual jOOQ source code generation in the
[jOOQ documentation](http://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/code-generation).

The plugin is hosted on the [Gradle Plugin portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/nu.studer.jooq).

# Applying the plugin

Apply the `nu.studer.jooq` plugin to your Gradle project.

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'nu.studer.jooq' version '4.2'
}
```

**Please note that due to non-backward compatible API changes in jOOQ between 3.10.x and 3.11.x, you must apply the following plugin version in your Gradle build:**
* **jOOQ library <= 3.10.x: gradle-jooq plugin 2.0.11**
* **jOOQ library >= 3.11.x: gradle-jooq plugin 3.0.0 or higher**

# Defining your database drivers

Depending on which database you are connecting to, you need to put the corresponding driver on the generator's classpath.

```groovy
dependencies {
    jooqRuntime 'org.postgresql:postgresql:42.2.12'
}
```

# Specifying the jOOQ version and edition

This plugin supports existing and future jOOQ versions. It also supports the different editions like open source, pro, and trial.

```groovy
jooq {
  version = '3.13.4' // the default (can be omitted)
  edition = 'OSS'    // the default (can be omitted), other allowed values are PRO, PRO_JAVA_8, PRO_JAVA_6, TRIAL, TRIAL_JAVA_8, TRIAL_JAVA_6
}
```

The plugin ensures that all your dependencies use the version and edition
specified in the `jooq` configuration. So when you declare a compile dependency
on jOOQ, you can omit the version:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'org.jooq:jooq'
}
```

# Tasks
For each jOOQ configuration declared in the build, the plugin adds a new `generate[ConfigurationName]JooqSchemaSource`
task to your project. Each task generates the jOOQ Java sources from the configured database schema and includes these
sources in the specified source set. For example, a jOOQ configuration named `sample` will cause the plugin to add a
new code generation task `generateSampleJooqSchemaSource` to the project.

```console
gradle generateSampleJooqSchemaSource
```

By default, the code generation tasks are automatically configured as dependencies of the corresponding source compilation tasks
provided by the `JavaBasePlugin` plugin. Hence, running a build that eventually needs to compile sources will first
trigger the required jOOQ code generation tasks. This auto-triggering of the code generation when compiling the
containing source set can be turned off by setting `generateSchemaSourceOnCompilation` to `false`.

You can delete all files in the folder that you configure as the output directory of the code generation task by running the
Gradle task rule `cleanGenerate[ConfigurationName]JooqSchemaSource`. Note that this task rule will delete _all_ files in the
configured output folder, regardless of whether the files were generated by the jOOQ plugin or not.

```console
gradle cleanGenerateSampleJooqSchemaSource
```

To see the log output of the jOOQ code generation tool, run the Gradle build with log level `info`:

```console
gradle build -i
```

# Configuration

The example below shows a jOOQ configuration that creates the jOOQ Java sources from a PostgreSQL database schema and
includes them in the `main` source set.

By default, the generated sources are written to `build/generated-src/jooq/<configurationName>`. The
output directory can be configured by explicitly setting the `directory` attribute of the `target` configuration.

See the [jOOQ XSD](https://www.jooq.org/xsd/jooq-codegen-3.13.0.xsd) for the full set of configuration options.

```groovy
jooq {
  version = '3.13.4'
  edition = 'OSS'
  generateSchemaSourceOnCompilation = true
  sample(sourceSets.main) {
    jdbc {
      driver = 'org.postgresql.Driver'
      url = 'jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/sample'
      user = 'some_user'
      password = 'secret'
      properties {
        property {
          key = 'ssl'
          value = 'true'
        }
      }
    }
    generator {
      name = 'org.jooq.codegen.DefaultGenerator'
      strategy {
        name = 'org.jooq.codegen.DefaultGeneratorStrategy'
        // ...
      }
      database {
        name = 'org.jooq.meta.postgres.PostgresDatabase'
        inputSchema = 'public'
        forcedTypes {
          forcedType {
            name = 'varchar'
            expression = '.*'
            types = 'JSONB?'
          }
          forcedType {
            name = 'varchar'
            expression = '.*'
            types = 'INET'
          }
        }
        // ...
      }
      generate {
        relations = true
        deprecated = false
        records = true
        immutablePojos = true
        fluentSetters = true
        // ...
      }
      target {
        packageName = 'nu.studer.sample'
        // directory = ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration pitfalls

### Configuring a sequence of elements

Resemblance of the jOOQ configuration DSL with the Groovy language is coincidental. Complex types that include
sequences like [ForcedTypes](https://www.jooq.org/xsd/jooq-codegen-3.13.0.xsd) must be defined in the DSL's nesting style:

```groovy
forcedTypes {
  forcedType {
    name = 'varchar'
    expression = '.*'
    types = 'JSONB?'
  }
  forcedType {
    name = 'varchar'
    expression = '.*'
    types = 'INET'
  }
}
```

The Groovy list style is **not** supported:

```groovy
forcedTypes = [
  {
    name = 'varchar'
    expression = '.*'
    types = 'JSONB?'
  },
  {
    name = 'varchar'
    expression = '.*'
    types = 'INET'
  }
]
```

### Defining the jOOQ version when the Spring boot plugin is applied

When applying the [spring-boot-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-gradle-plugin),
it is not sufficient to declare the jOOQ version that you want to pull in via `jooq.version = '3.13.4'` since the dependency management rules of the spring-boot-gradle-plugin
take precedence. You also have to set `ext['jooq.version'] = '3.13.4'` to pull in your requested version of jOOQ.

### Generating sources into shared folders, e.g. src/main/java

My recommendation is to generate the jOOQ sources into a distinct folder, e.g. _src/generated/jooq_ or _build/generated-src/jooq_ (default). This avoids overlapping
outputs, and it also keeps the door open to let Gradle cache the generated sources which can be a significant build performance gain. The rationale is explained very
well in the [Build Cache User Guide](https://guides.gradle.org/using-build-cache/#concepts_overlapping_outputs).
